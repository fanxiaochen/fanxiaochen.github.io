### About Me ###

I am now a master student in **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**. My main research topics focus on **computer graphics**, especially **geometry and 3d reconstruction**. But I also have interests in other graphics\' areas like rendering and simulation. 

Moreover, I decide to start learning **computer vision** as well. Although it is totally inverse problem to cg, I believe the combination of cg and cv will become very powerful in the near future.

### About This Blog ###

Previously I haven\'t get used to writing personal notes or blog about knowledge and thoughts. But finally I realized I was wrong. No one could remember things forever. Above all, the process of writing has much help on deep understanding about what you\'re studying.

Hope this blog could encourage self-study or somebody happens to be here:-)
